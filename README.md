Fast Collage For Win allows you to quickly assemble collages from photos, edit each image freely, and work either with a blank canvas or with automatically generated layouts(in the pipeline).
Two Working Modes

Free Collage
   
Ideal if you want complete creative freedom:
* empty canvas with no layout restrictions;
* unlimited number of images (limited only by memory);
* free movement, scaling, and rotation of images;
* perfect for creative and non-standard compositions.

Random Collage(in the pipeline)
   
Ideal for fast and structured results:
* you choose the number of images;
* the app generates a layout specifically for that number;
* the layout fully fills the canvas with no empty areas;
* each image is placed into its own frame (slot);
* images can be swapped, scaled, rotated, and mirrored inside their frames.

<img width="2485" height="1438" alt="test1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3745ac2b-32c7-49b8-b94d-d2b822e7df5c" />

Image Editing

* images can be added:
  * by dragging directly from the file explorer;
  * via a dedicated preview panel;

* images can be:
  * scaled using the mouse wheel(ctrl+mouse);
  * rotated(shift+mouse);
  * mirrored horizontally or vertically(ctrl+shitf+H, ctrl+shift+V);
  * repositioned inside a frame(Z+mouse);

* in template mode:
  * anything outside the frame is automatically clipped;
  * images never overlap or interfere with each other.

* canvas zoom using the mouse wheel(ctrl+mouse).

* undo and redo support(ctrl+Z, ctrl+Y).

Preview Panel

The application includes a convenient side panel:
  * preload all images in one place;
  * view image thumbnails;
  * drag images onto the canvas or into template slots;
  * remove images from the collage and return them to the panel(button X);
  * the panel can be shown or hidden as needed.

This eliminates the need to repeatedly browse folders and significantly speeds up workflow.

Export

* export collages to common formats (PNG, JPEG);
* output exactly matches the canvas size;
* ready for printing or digital publishing.

Who PhotoCollage Is For
* users who need quick and clean collage creation;
* designers and photographers preparing layouts;
* people creating photo books, posters, previews, or social media content;
* anyone looking for a powerful yet easy-to-understand collage tool.
